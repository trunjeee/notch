/// clipboard and not about the calendar, or the other way round. The menu still
/// offers "All" first, because that is the answer most of the time and the one
/// nobody has to think about.
///
/// The choice outlives launches — forgetting to turn covering *on* is what
/// costs something, so it must not depend on remembering.

/// Nothing here decides *what* is a secret. Guessing at addresses and card
/// numbers with a regular expression fails silently and tells the user about it
/// only afterwards, on the recording; covering everything in a chosen section
/// is predictable, and predictability is the feature.
